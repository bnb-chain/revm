# Point Evaluation Precompile

This precompile is introduced in [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844) and is used to verify KZG commitments of blobs. The precompile allows for efficient verification of commitments to blob transactions. Blob transactions contain a large amount of data that cannot be accessed by EVM execution, but has a commitment that can be accessed and verified. The EIP is designed to be forward compatible with [Danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) architecture while giving L2s access to cheaper L1 commitments. This precompiled contract resides at the hardcoded Ethereum address `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000A`.

A useful resource is the Python reference implementation for the precompile, which can be found [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/86fb82b221474cc89387fa6436806507b3849d88/specs/deneb/polynomial-commitments.md). The implementation in REVM uses [c-kzg-4844](https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844), via its [foreign function interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) bindings, from the Ethereum Foundation.
